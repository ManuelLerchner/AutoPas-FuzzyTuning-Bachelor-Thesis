# Bachelor's Thesis: "Exploring Fuzzy Tuning Technique for Molecular Dynamics Simulations in AutoPas"

This repository contains all the collected data, scripts, and the final thesis document for my `Bachelor Thesis` at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).
The thesis was written at the `Chair of Scientific Computing` under the supervision of [Manish Kumar Mishra](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/sccs/personen/manish-kumar-mishra/) and [Samuel Newcome](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/sccs/people/samuel-james-newcome).

The thesis explores a novel tuning technique for molecular dynamics simulations in the [AutoPas](https://github.com/AutoPas/AutoPas) framework. The technique is based on fuzzy logic and aims to predict close-to-optimal simulation configurations from a set of live data collected during the simulation. The goal of this thesis is to evaluate the feasibility of the fuzzy tuning technique and to compare it with existing tuning techniques.
