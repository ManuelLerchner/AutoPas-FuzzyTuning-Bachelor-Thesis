# Notes Meeting 24.04.2024

- try to predict container for now

- test with cubes of different density
  - create dataset wirh full search, maybe use linear regression to find corelations or an interactive rule tuner, keep the data
  - timestep 0

- find cases that works, Proof of concept

- xml, zip the libxerces depwndency

- good fuzzy outputs; paralelizability, enhanced density

- multiple fuzzy systems should work
  - exclude parameters that are not predicted use full search afterwards

- cmake log input iterations

- ferienakademie?
