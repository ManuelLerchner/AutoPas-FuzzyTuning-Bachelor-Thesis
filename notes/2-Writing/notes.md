# Writing Notes

+ Make Diagram of certain rule activations
  + Plot 3d decision surface, and in which region what configuration is selected

+ Make diagram of "filter" to show how the sequential tuning straegies iteratevly remove configurations

## Future work

+ Configurations options arent independent. So fuzzy rules depend on each other. One possibiliy is to simply nest the fuzzy system to account for this.

+ Genetic Algorithm to find tuning the fuzzy system
