I extend my sincere gratitude to my advisors, Sam and Manish, for their invaluable guidance and feedback throughout this thesis. Their expertise and insights have been instrumental in shaping the direction of this work, and I greatly appreciated our engaging discussions.

I'm also grateful to the Chair of Scientific Computing and Professor Dr. Hans-Joachim Bungartz for providing me with the opportunity to work on this project. Moreover, I would like to thank the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre for providing the necessary computational resources for this research.

Finally, I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to my family and friends. The unwavering support of my family enabled me to fully focus on my studies, while my friends offered both distractions when I needed breaks and inspiration when I needed motivation. Without them, this journey would have been far less enjoyable.
