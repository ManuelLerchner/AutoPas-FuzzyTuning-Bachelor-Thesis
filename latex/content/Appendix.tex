The following fields are currently available in the IterationData file. The IterationData file is a CSV file containing the configuration and performance data for each iteration of the simulation. The data is collected and logged by the \texttt{IterationLogger} class of the AutoPas library.

  \item[Iteration] Current iteration number of the simulation.
  \item[inTuningPhase] Indicates whether the simulation is in the tuning phase (true/false).

\section{Density Plots of Relative Speed present in the Dataset}

To investigate the collected data, we performed some exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends in the dataset. We created density plots to visualize the distribution of the relative speed based on different configuration options.

  \caption[Speedup density plot based on the Newton 3 option]{Density plot showing the distribution of the relative speed based on the Newton 3 option. We can see that enabling Newton3 is generally the better option, allowing for a higher relative speeds. All performances with relative speed of at least 80\% use the Newton3 optimization. Therefore, we can confirm that Newton 3 is generally a good option to enable.}
