Title:
Towards the Smarter Tuning of Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Abstract:
The large computational cost of pairwise force calculations within Molecular Dynamics requires the use of specialist algorithms, such as Linked Cells or Verlet Lists, as well as efficient ways of parallelising such algorithms. There is, however, no ``silver bullet'' best algorithm for all simulations, and the best algorithm can change over the course of a simulation. AutoPas is a node-level particle simulation library that aims to dynamically select the most optimal algorithm, vectorisation str...     Â»
